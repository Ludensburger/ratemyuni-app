# RateMyUni

Simple review app created with the MERN stack.

This project is just a fun project to try and build a functional end to end web application using the MERN stack and to study how to implement displaying of data with the REST API and implementation of the sonner toast library for errors.

This project is still under development and I pray to God it actually gets finished. :)

## Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your root folder's .env file

MONGO = `CONNECTION STRING`

JWT_SECRET = `CUSTOM SECRET KEY`

And another .env file inside the client folder. This is for the OAuth.

VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY = `FIREBASE_API_KEY`


## Optimizations

I'm still fairly new so my code will probably look horrible as I'm really just diving into this blindly. I have knowledge of the fundamentals but the React framework is new to me and I've only been learning parts from the Tech Stack that I actually need for the project, so basically nothing comprehensive yet.
